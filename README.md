# dash-heroku
A running starter pack for deploying a Plotly Dash app on Heroku with support for hosting static files, such as images (a common pain point). For a comprehensive explanatory guide, see my [article](https://medium.com/p/39bd6a0c586c) on Towards Data Science :)

This app can be viewed live on Heroku infrastructure at [https://secret-scrubland-35610.herokuapp.com/](https://secret-scrubland-35610.herokuapp.com/)

## Instructions

A full step-by-step guide is provided below to help you get your first Heroku app live. 
If you are a first-timer on Heroku, I suggest you get this starter app running on Heroku first, then you can adapt it to suit your needs by copy-pasting your locally running Dash app code across etc. 
Heroku also has a concise guide for [getting started on Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) which is a useful reference.
<br><br>

## 1. Clone this repo to your local machine and install modules

It's a good idea to check you can get this app running on your local webserver before attempting to deploy on Heroku. So let's do that.
Setup your virtualenv (or don't) and ensure you have all the modules installed before running the app. 

**Getting the repo to your local machine** <br>
If you are  new to Github and not familiar with cloning, SSH and all that jazz, you can all just download a zip file of this entire repo like a normal internet download. Basically get a copy of this repo to your local machine as step 1. (Hit the green 'code' button in the top right on Github to see the options for cloning or downloading this repo). Later on when you want to make changes to your repo, you will need to use Git commands and have ssh setup, or you can use the [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application, which is really nice on Windows and Mac.

**Install modules from the requirements.txt** <br>
You should be able to do this with pip3 or conda from a terminal in the project root folder

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`conda install --file requirements.txt` (if you are using Anaconda)
<br><br>

## 2. Test the app locally

Run the app from your IDE direct, or like a boss from the terminal: `python3 app.py`

If it runs, it should be visible on a browser via `http://0.0.0.0:8050`
<br><br>

## 3. Setup Heroku command-line-interface (CLI)

Depending on your OS, you may also need to install Git. Follow the general Heroku CLI [installation guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). 
<br><br>

## 4. Create a Heroku account

You will also need a Heroku account (free tier is fine for a hobby app). Sign up [here](https://signup.heroku.com/login).
<br><br>

## 5. Login to Heroku via CLI

From your terminal window, login to Heroku CLI. This will open a browser window and you will need to login to your new Heroku account. 
Once done, return to your terminal and it should say 'Logged in as .... blah' (GOOD)

`heroku login`
<br><br>

## 6. Create a Heroku app linked to the Dash app

Now we must create a Heroku app that will magically link to your Dash app. ENSURE YOU ARE IN THE DASH PROJECT ROOT FOLDER IN A TERMINAL. Heroku docs on this step [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#deploy-the-app).

`heroku create`

The above command will create your heroku app with a special unique name on the Heroku infrastructure. This name will be part of the public URL that gets created for your live app on the Heroku subdomain. So if you want a custom name that is a bit more intelligible, you can specify a name, but note Heroku will give an error if that name is already taken on their subdomain (by another Heroku user). So you may need to make it highly specific. 

`heroku create youruniqueappname`

You may need to try a few different options to find a unique name, but once done, your public URL will be prettier and easier to remember.
<br><br>

## 7. Deploy your app on Heroku

We are ready for the magic to begin. We will now do a Git push command to your remote Heroku app repository (which lives behind the scenes) and this will trigger a build of your Heroku app! 

`git push heroku main`

You should begin to see a bunch of console output in the terminal as Heroku deploys your app. Note it takes about 3 minutes. It should work fine on this repo, but as you add your own code in, be ready to watch for errors. Tip: as soon as the build finishes, bring up the live log tail with `heroku logs --tail`. This will show you the processes happening immediately after the build: Gunicorn web process trying to bring up your app.
<br><br> 

## 8. View your running public app in a browser!

If the build succeeds, you will be given a URL at the end that might look something like [https://secret-scrubland-35610.herokuapp.com/](https://secret-scrubland-35610.herokuapp.com/) (this is live so you can see the app deployed). 
Copy paste the URL from your OWN console output into a browser, and with a few shakes of fairy dust, your app should be live :)
<br><br>

## 9. (OPTIONAL) Transfer your own Dash app code over to the app

Once you have the app running on Heroku, you can build on it as a base to get your own Dash app live. You could fork the repository, create your own stand alone repo and copy these project files over from the directory, or do it in a variety of ways. Just be wary that Heroku can be a bit temperamental with some Python packages. Be careful of your app's RAM requirements too, remembering that you only have 500MB of memory to play with (on the free Heroku tier), far less than you might be used to compared with your local machine.

# Important Notes

**Sometimes you may need to create a new Heroku app** <br>
If you make major changes to file structure in your project, you may need to create a new Heroku app with `heroku create` and then `git push heroku main`. This can be annoying but it's only one extra step. I found that once my file structure was stable, if I was just changing code within an existing file, to deploy a new version just ensure you update your remote repo on github i.e. `git push origin main` FIRST. When your remote repo is fully up to date with the latest changes, then you can redeploy to Heroku really easily with a simple `git push heroku main`

**Heroku sometimes might not support the latest python modules** <br>
Just be aware that you may not be able to use the very latest packages. I think Heroku has to add special support for this so their packages can sometimes trail the latest ones you may be running on your local machine. You will see errors if this happens though so it will be obvious when you try to build and deploy. Just watch the console.

**If your build succeeds but you get 'APPLICATION ERROR' in the Browser** <br>
This is highly annoying, but it means something went wrong after the build, when the Gunicorn webserver tried to bring up your app. To view what is going on at a low level the most direct way is to view the live log tail from the terminal (console). This will show you the dyno web process (i.e. Gunicorn) trying to come up. And if there is a crash you can see what has gone wrong. Also note, this log tail will view console output from your app itself (print statements and logger statements etc) so it's a great way to get a low level view of your app, similar to when you are running it from your local machine; it just has extra stuff in it such as Heroku errors and Dyno errors mixed in aswell. Just type this command into your terminal window after the build has finished.

`heroku logs --tail`
